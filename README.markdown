## Welcome to my blog

Hello everyone, hello distinguished githubers, open source and programming amateurs.

At last time i have become very to hear that many peoples start their blogs on github.com with Jekyll, i think it's very cool idea. And I began to think about creating blog in github. But i'm not web programmer, and i don't like tinkering with html/css since my university days. In one day, i was thinking about you following thing: github is great place to blogging without Jekyll and other template engines, i write post in markdown and push it to repo. Murkdown is a great thing, i can write rich text, i can put listings of code and finally i can put images in post.markdown, What else you need for a full technical blog? Nothing... You can ask me, blog post comments? Yes, i think it's not problem. If you want to comment some post you can fork https://github.com/sterh/github-as-blog, edit post, add

@YOUR_NICK

your comment ....

to the end of post and pull request it. Also we can use github issues as platform for commenting.

Then another nice thing about blog in github is no need in RSS. Github has excellent opportunity Watch repo, you can push watch and all blog updates you will see in you github dashboard.

Now let's talk the most interesting. What is about this blog? Of course open source, programming and technology. Every i week, I'll try to write about different projects that i and my colleagues using in our work, which hosted in github and not only.  

I think it will be interesting.

Thank you all.
